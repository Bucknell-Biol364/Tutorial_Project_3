This project will require you to develop a tutorial to teach Bucknell students how to use R for graphing and data analysis. 

## Target Audience

Discuss with your group the target audience for the tutorial. 
Examples could be one of the new core Biology classes, another 300-level course (not 364), or a research group. 

```{r echo=FALSE}

```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r Load Libraries, include=FALSE}
# Load other packages here.
if (!require("datasauRus")) install.packages("datasauRus"); library(datasauRus)
if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse"); library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
Covid_19<-read_csv("./Data/Provisional_COVID-19_Deaths_by_Sex_and_Age.csv")
str(Covid_19)
```


## Grading

Each student will be expected to complete the following tasks to earn 85% of the points available for this assignment (21/25).

- Identify and obtain suitable dataset
- Use a Github repository and version control to collaborate on the project
- Spend 4-6 hours preparing, coding, and testing tutorial
  + Data exploration
  + Data visualization
  + Hypothesis testing
- Present tutorial in class
- Provide public archive suitable for sharing to students/faculty

Tutorials from previous classes can be viewed at our public github site: https://github.com/Bucknell-Biol364

Each group should use an *Acknowledgements* section to document the participation of each member and the collaboration within and between groups.

Additional credit will be awarded for providing assistance to other groups and for the development of a tutorial that goes beyond the minimal expectations listed above.
