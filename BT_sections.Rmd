## Code for Ranking net Deaths by State

nlevels(Covid_19$State)
summary(Covid_19$State)
#54 states, need to remove non-states

#Filter functions (one to be used as an example of != and one to be used as an example of ==)
Covid_19.S<-filter(Covid_19, State != "United States" & State != "District of Columbia" & State != "New York City" & State != "Puerto Rico")

#ensuring filter process worked

#data display
