# Welcome to Epidemiology

## Today we will be completing a tutorial in RStudio.

To begin the tutorial, complete the following steps:
1. Make sure you have RStudio open and then navigate back to github
2. Click on the green code button in the upper right hand side of the screen. 
3. Click "download zip" which will load the zip file into your downloads file 
4. Locate the files in your downloads and relocate the documents to a new folder on your computer.
- This folder should be easily accessible. I recommend in documents or on your desktop.
5. Open RStudio back up and press on the files tab in the lower right hand side of the screen.
6. Find the file that you saved the documents in and open the Project01.FINAL.Rmd file to start the tutorial
7. Have fun!
